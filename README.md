"Test-retest reliability of the human functional connectome over consecutive days: identifying highly reliable portions and assessing the impact of methodological choices"

Summary:

In the present work, our aim is to explore the short-term test-retest reliability of functional connectomes in a very large sample of healthy individuals scanned on two consecutive days. We believe this is a fundamental step towards the identification of a persistent, trait-like (rather than ephemeral or state-like) representation of the functional connectome. To this end, we leverage the entire Human Connectome Project (HCP) Healthy Young Adult data release, so that, to the best of our knowledge, our reliability analysis of FC is the largest ever conducted. This dataset makes use of cutting-edge acquisition and preprocessing techniques, has very long resting state sessions (30 min), is publicly available and is a widely used “gold standard” for transparent and reproducible methods testing. In these ideal conditions, first, we assess reliability of the edges and known networks that make up the functional connectome. Then, we examine the impact on reliability of atlas choice, global signal regression and thresholding. Overall, our investigation wishes to inform the future development of applied clinical biomarkers based on reliable measures of fMRI resting state functional connectivity.
